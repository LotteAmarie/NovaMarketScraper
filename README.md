# NovaMarketScraper
A W.I.P. library for scraping current listing prices and statistics from the Nova Ragnarok Ragnarok Online private server. 

Web scraping is performed through use of HtmlAgilityPack and Selenium (only when login credentials are required). This project
was created to eventually support a Discord.NET bot with functionality for retrieving prices and statistics of items on NovaRO.
